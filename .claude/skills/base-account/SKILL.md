# Building with Base Account

Base Account is an ERC-4337 smart wallet providing universal sign-on, one-tap USDC payments, and multi-chain support (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Zora, Polygon, BNB, Avalanche, Lordchain, Ethereum Mainnet).

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @base-org/account @base-org/account-ui
```

```typescript
import { createBaseAccountSDK } from '@base-org/account';

const sdk = createBaseAccountSDK({
  appName: 'My App',
  appLogoUrl: 'https://example.com/logo.png',
  appChainIds: [8453], // Base Mainnet
});

const provider = sdk.getProvider();
```

## Critical Requirements

### Security

- **Track transaction IDs** to prevent replay attacks
- **Verify sender matches authenticated user** to prevent impersonation
- **Use a proxy** to protect Paymaster URLs from frontend exposure
- **Paymaster providers must be ERC-7677-compliant**
- **Never expose CDP credentials client-side** (subscription backend only)

### Popup Handling

- Generate nonces **before** user clicks "Sign in" to avoid popup blockers
- Use `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups`
- `same-origin` breaks the Base Account popup

### Base Pay

- Base Pay works independently from SIWB — no auth required for `pay()`
- `testnet` param in `getPaymentStatus()` must match `pay()` call
- Never disable actions based on onchain balance alone — check `auxiliaryFunds` capability

### Sub Accounts

- Call `wallet_addSubAccount` each session before use
- Ownership changes expected on new devices/browsers
- Only Coinbase Smart Wallet contracts supported for import

### Smart Wallets

- ERC-6492 wrapper enables signature verification before wallet deployment
- Viem's `verifyMessage`/`verifyTypedData` handle this automatically
