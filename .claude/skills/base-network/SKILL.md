# Connecting to Base Network

## Mainnet

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Network Name | Base |
| Chain ID | 8453 |
| RPC Endpoint | `https://mainnet.base.org` |
| Currency | ETH |
| Explorer | https://basescan.org |

## Testnet (Sepolia)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Network Name | Base Sepolia |
| Chain ID | 84532 |
| RPC Endpoint | `https://sepolia.base.org` |
| Currency | ETH |
| Explorer | https://sepolia.basescan.org |

## Security

- **Never use public RPC endpoints in production** — they are rate-limited and offer no privacy guarantees; use a dedicated node provider or self-hosted node
- **Never embed RPC API keys in client-side code** — proxy requests through a backend to protect provider credentials
- **Validate chain IDs** before signing transactions to prevent cross-chain replay attacks
- **Use HTTPS RPC endpoints only** — reject any `http://` endpoints to prevent credential interception

## Critical Notes

- Public RPC endpoints are **rate-limited** - not for production
- For production: use node providers or run your own node
- Testnet ETH available from faucets in Base documentation

## Wallet Setup

1. Add network with chain ID and RPC from tables above
2. For testnet, use Sepolia configuration
3. Bridge ETH from Ethereum or use faucets
